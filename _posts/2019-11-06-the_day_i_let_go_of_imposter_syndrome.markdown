  I had struggled passing my first Rails assessment. I tried 3 times and didn't make it. My project worked well it was clean and did what it was supposed to do. My problem was I could not talk in technical terms. I was doubting if I even could do this. To get over this actually took months. I joined another cohort went thru the Rails labs, did 90% of them over again. Studying the basics of rails, read every little blue hi-lited link in Learn, watched videos, reading it out loud, doing ruby challenges on codewars, going to meet ups with live coding challenges(I didn't particapate more on this in a minute), reading other peoples code, listening to pod casts and letting go of fear. That is what it took to pass my assessment. Rails was just the gauge, the test, the assessment was about becoming a developer. The challenge was letting go of fear and truly embracing change. Not passing my assessment was really the best thing for me, it gave me an oppourtunity to really think about what I wanted and why.
	
	  The live coding challenge was a python developer making change for a float. He had to make change with the smallest amount of coins. They didn't finish the challenge but he talked thru his logic the whole time. He recieved feed back that was good for him but it was gold for me. It changed my whole outlook at what was in front of me. What I realized was he wasn't smarter then me. He had just been doing it longer. That construct of smart, stupid, good or bad was my problem. He didn't have any of that. He just talked thru his logic step by step. Getting closer to the goal was good enough. Showing he could communicate was so important that he got an applause. I really changed my life. Today when fear creeps in I take a moment and breathe. I read something else and come back later. I use a pomodoro timer and don't sit infront of the screen till my eyes bleed. This technology will always evolve and we need to be students for life.
