      This past week I struggled thru the labs. I knew I was learning something but was unable to show it. For me the project was a blessing it allowed me to focus my frustrations in a different direction. I also get frustrated by bad reviews for restaurants that are great! The full functionality won't be available thru this version......We have started with some fun css emojis and some bright red! That is the color of desire and who doesn't desire food. On our site we focus on posting fun, short, postive reviews that connect food lovers with great food all over the world. So come check it out! You can sign  up, login and logout safely with the help of the bcrypt gem. Want content? With the help of activerecord sinatra creating, reading, updating and deleting the data that makes I ❤ resto special! I almost forgot corneal! This made setting up my tree and environment a breeze. As look back at what I have accomplished there really is no turning back.
