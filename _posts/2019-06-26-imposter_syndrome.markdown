So the past few weeks have been  a struggle. I lost pace, fell behind, had issues with my local environment and had to start over. I rushed thru everything just to catch up! Had no idea what was going on and started reviewing rails from the beginning again. I felt defeated, lost and worn out. Thankfully the break is coming up giving me some extra time before the project. I had to step back, give myself a break, a pat on the back for the progress I have made and appreciate how far I had come. So I worked really hard and didn't get everything! So what this is hard! I gave myself a break looked at the time I have and relized I was gonna be ok. That was difficult for me. Growing up I was taught being on time was everything. If I didn't have it done on time then I wasn't trying hard enough. I had to let the blockers and the hang ups go. I had to forgive myself. I am not a developer with years under my belt that just understands what is going on. One day I will be......
