This is a list of objects that keep me going.
   1: If it was easy everyone would do it
   2: No one one is born with this knowledge
   3: Every student is at the same place, the beginning
   4: When in doubt ask google
   5: Still in doubt ask a question(stop doubting)
   6: I want a better life for me and my family
   7: I want a better life for the people of the world
   8: This the future and we will shape it
   9: When you don't get it take a break
10: When you do get it take a break
11: When you don't get it keep going
12: When you do get it keep going
13: When you are tired drink coffee, eat, stretch and move around

That is my bakers dozen! What is yours!
