     My name is Blackwell. I live in Chattanooga TN.  I used to cook for a living. Being a chef means long hours 6 to 7 days a week and little time for family. I threw in the towel on day to day operations and started driving Uber and Lyft. This work gave me the flexibility to have a life and gave me time to figure out what the next chapter was. I met thousands of people and 99% of the time we had the same basic conversation. What I learned was the growth of these businesses had just begun, it improved the quality of peoples lives and saved them money. People from all over the world have moved to Chattanooga for the 10 gig internet(yes google it). Job oppourtunity?  Well how does this work, how do you connect drivers with riders, how do we share location information? It looks like software developement could be the answer.
 
     I didn't need a degree? I can make great money? I could learn this on my own? I can work from home? What I had no idea? Little did I know in the beginning that you need to do it every day, spending multiple days away from my computer. This left me, what felt further away from my goal.  I realized I needed more direction. EDX had an introduction to Python. I took it, passed and considered my options. First of all I needed more direction, I did not feel connected to any system that could help me move forward with EDX. Second I need a career not a hobby. Yes coding is fun but I am not 15 years old. Searching the internet I found many options available for paid training. I did research and signed up for several bootcamps. Flatiron had several campuses, high percentage of job placement, the month to month payment worked for me and I felt like I got a taste of what attending flatiron would be like. A few weeks in on the bootcamp I made a decision. The Flatiron bootcamp helped me move past those fears and doubts. I may not know much now but I will soon.
