At the begining of the JS section it was familar. I had studied, read and done some challenges on JS before I started Flatiron. As the section moved on the concepts are pretty much the same as in Ruby but the syntax is more nuanced, prone to little bugs and harder to code. It didn't flow or maybe I wasn't flowing with it. When It came to project time I was getting nervous. I liked the Rails set up it's friendly and nice. JS is demanding and needy. JS isn't intuitive until you stop being afraid of it. JS gives you more freedom and allows you to make choices that Rails is pretty clear on. It was interesting I grow thru the project and slowly I could work my way thru little issues. Towards the end I started coming up with more ideas and felt comfortable trying those. I added a counter on the profile page and have plans to add a comment feed for tips and hash tag search bar. I also have plans for publishing my app. Last week was the first time I felt like a developer and not a beginner.
