I like rails and it's built in personality. It gives you everything you need, without the ability to use it. Rails is like your Grandma. Rails wants to help so much it can be over bearing. In my family we call that "Telping". If you don't get it I'll telp you. Basically when my Grandma "tells" me how to do something she is only trying to "help". Rails give you all the routes, tables, views, models, controllers and all the built in CRUD functionality. It may seem like your rails Grandma is forcing you into her way, but really she is just holding your hand. This is very helpful because I struggle remembering syntax. review_path is pretty easy to remember and it does exactly what it says, send your user to the next appropriate action or view along the review_path. If you don't listen,  your rails Grandma will  send you to your room for more debugging. During my rails journey I encountered some personal difficulties. I feel behind and didn't finish all the course work(I read it all just didn't finish ever lab). This didn't hinder my ability to finish the project. If you can understand CRUD you can understand rails. During my project I actually made functionality more complicated then needed. The more I let rails be rails the more I could be me.    
		Retraining my brain to become a developer has been interesting.  I am not sure what direction I want to go in yet. If I keep my mind open and  get these skills under my belt. I will probably end up doing things I never imagined or everything I imagined will become a reality.
